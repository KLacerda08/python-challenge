Financial Analysis

Financial records were evaluated. Starting data included a table with dates (month-year) and profit/losses. 
Financial records were evaluated to find the following:  

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

The results have been exported to file Financial_Results.txt
